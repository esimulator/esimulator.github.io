##üí° Inspiration
Many young people dream of seeing themselves as a professional esports player or at least a game streamer. But even in these professions, there is a lot of necessary knowledge and skills that you need to possess. As well as many ambiguous life situations that you can get into.

And I decided to create a simulator that will allow you to go through all this, learn something new and test yourself. I saw the creation of an educational, fun and interactive game about e-sportsman and streamer life as an ideal option.

Five reasons for using games in learning and dialogue:

- They encourage active learning and active engagement in dialogues.
- Games allow you to simplify complex systems. 
- In games, you have to take decisions and receive feedback on the result of that decision.
- Games provide opportunity for reflection, discovery, exploration and challenge.
- And they are fun! Considering that emotions matter in learning ‚Äì this is also a serious goal.

## ‚ö°Ô∏èWhat it does
The created product is an educational, fun and interactive game that is dedicated to the theme of e-sport and game streaming.

In the game, you play as a beginner e-sportsman and streamer who decides to take his place in the world of e-sport.

You have to test yourself with quests, make meaningful life decisions and participate in cool e-sport events.

At each stage you will learn something new about the e-sport, update your knowledge and in the end you will find out how cool you are and get your rank.

## üë®‚Äçüíª How I built it
1. I looked through a bunch of e-sport information, collected useful information and ideas.
2. I made sketches of what will be the plot, gameplay and decided how to fit all the collected information into one game.
3. I developed the frontend part with HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery and filled with content.
4. I took care of the testing, bug fix and finishing the ideas that appeared in the process.

## ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Challenges I ran into
- Before the hackathon I was mostly only the Dota 2 fun, but during the hackathon I was needed to prepare content and materials for another games and topics.
- I was needed to create a gameplay that, on the one hand, is interesting and at the same time gives knowledge.
- Inventing a game plot, selecting suitable content.

## üíú Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- In a fairly short period of time, I managed to develop the project that I wanted to build.
- I have developed an educational, fun and interactive game that will help raise people's awareness of e-sport.
